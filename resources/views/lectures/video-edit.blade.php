Hello, future creator! I am glad to see you here :) This course will provide an opportunity to learn the skill of video editing, understand the specifics of Stories from the inside, improve their quality, and also find clients - your favorite bloggers. Good luck! ️

1. Base. Video editing on the phone.

The best mobile video editors — are «Inshot» and «Videoleap». 
The first one has native interface, everything is clear. You can trim clips, change the speed of your footage, and add filters, music, and text. You can also flip and rotate footage, which is a handy feature that many other apps don’t have. InShot app is simple to use and has everything you need. This app is perfect for creators who want an app that does it all without too many frills.
Videoleap — powerful editor. Even in the free version you have access to three video and audio tracks, a variety of text options, keyframing, green screen, color adjustment and much more. In the full version you will also get an infinite number of tracks and a lot of other tricks. It is also a very simple app, that is easy to understand. 
Here you can see the promos of «Inshot» and «Videoleap», that show what you can create in these applications:

I also made for you a small video lesson to show you the main features of the application:

2. Music.

To make cool videos you have to be able to choose the right music. In Inshot you can find free tracks, or you can extract audio from videos that you have on your phone (for example, screen video record of TikTok), you can also import music from your voice records or other applications.
We match the audio to the mood of the video, adjust video track to music dynamics. At the peaks in the music track, it is better to make splices in the video or put some actions. Let’s see how to use audio in your Stories:

Stories are still being deleted for music, to avoid this better:
 - use tracks from unknown artists
 - slow down / speed up tracks (you can do this in Inshot by changing the speed of the video with the track and then extracting the audio)

3. Text (subtitles).

Now the trend is to duplicate with text what the blogger says in the video. What is it for?
It's not a secret that most people watch stories without sound, and in order to increase the likelihood that subscribers will watch to the end (this affects statistics), you need to be able to understand what the author is talking about. How to make beautiful subtitles on video, let's see:

4. Video Design.

Now people are already tired of a million Instagram filters on one video or photo, they want to see naturalness and sincerity. I will show you my favorite applications for making beautiful stories:
 - Nichi (the wonderful application for text & photo stories) + Pinterest (you can use it for searching for an idea for photo and combine colors on photos and text stories: just use the word “palette” to find the color combination suitable for you)

5. How to make your stories watched.

Stories is the powerful and very useful tool for all bloggers on Instagram. This helps the blogger to have good statistics so that people subscribe to the blogger and the Instagram promotes her / him.
To make your stories watched they need to be interesting, with good quality and nice design. Now you have a list of free applications, that will help you to make your videos dynamic and nice looking. I will give you some tips how to get the subscriber interested in your stories:

- Tests within the blog topic.
 You can make a small test for your subscribers, it is always interesting for people. I do like different test, and statistics of my bloggers says that I am not only one :) 
Tests should be understandable to both new and old readers, the answers should briefly explain the very essence. If the topic is narrow and not familiar to many, you need to support the questions with an explanation in pictures.
For example, if you have a blog about style, you can make a brief test (several stories) with the question “Where is the trend and where is the anti-trend?”

- Polls where subscribers will be involved in the blogger's life. 
It can be:
1. "What clothes should I wear today?" - edit videos in different clothes and create a poll

2. “What should I do today”  + answers box

3. "Should I buy this dress" + poll yes/ no

- Reactions.
You can ask your readers to send you reactions. For instance,  it can be a question “Do you like how I look today? Send me a reaction: SMILE if yes SMILE if no SMAYLIK TIPA YA SMUSHAYUS”
Not everyone understands what “reaction” means, so attach screen like this to your story with a request:

This is the example of the story:

- Games
Games are another way for your audience to interact with your stories. You can make them by yourself or take ready-made ones. I do not recommend posting the same game every day, it gets boring, it is better to alternate and take breaks.

Games examples:

1. Can you find photoshop?
You need to edit a photo, then put the original photo and the processed one in turn, or vice versa. Add a poll, and subscribers will have to guess which image was edited. Usually bloggers a little deform different parts of the body: reduce / increase the waist, facial features, etc. Applications suitable for this: AirBrush, Meitu, Facetune 2.

2. Find the differences
You need to remove some objects in the photo and put the original and the processed photo in turn, or vice versa. Readers should count the number of differences. The “stamp” tool in Snapseed or PicsArt applications is suitable for this.

3. Find out something
The game consists in the fact that the stories very quickly change phrases related to the topic, for example, "find out your plan for the day" and the phrases "watch the series", "spend day with friends", "make cupcakes" and so on. You can do it using the Bazaart application, watch the video to find out how:

4. Catch me (or some object)
The game is that the subscriber has to catch an object in the outlined shape. Created frame by frame using photo editing and processing in the bazaart app:

5. Count objects on the video
You can put several objects (it can be stickers) during the the video and then ask your readers how many objects were on the. Let’s see an example:
